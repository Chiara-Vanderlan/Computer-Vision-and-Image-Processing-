#Question 1
#To reduce the number of intensity levels in an image from 256 to 2, in integer powers of 2. 
#The desired number of intensity levels needs to be a variable input to your program.

import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

#Function to reduce the intensity level when the image path and intensity level is given 
def processing(path, levels):
    
    #Opening the image
    image = Image.open(path)

    #Converting the image to greyscale
    image_gray = image.convert("L")

    #Converting image into array 
    image_array = np.array(image_gray)

    #adjusting to the intensity level
    scale_factor = 255 / (levels -1)
    quanlized_image = (np.round(image_array / scale_factor)* scale_factor).astype(np.uint8)

    #Converting array into image
    final_image = Image.fromarray(quanlized_image)

    return final_image


#Path of the image
path = "dog.jpg"

#inserting the intensity level
intensity_levels = int(input('No.of intensity levels : '))

#Calling the function
processed_image = processing(path,intensity_levels)
#Saving the image
processed_image.save("Q1/Reduced_intensity.jpg")
